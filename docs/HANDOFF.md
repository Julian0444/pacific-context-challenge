## Sessions 1–17 — Consolidated Summary (2026-04-05 → 2026-04-12)

### Build Timeline

| Session | Date | What was done | Tests after |
|---------|------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | 04-05 | Project bootstrap: repo scaffolding, 12-doc financial corpus (Atlas Capital / Meridian "Project Clearwater"), FAISS indexer + retriever | 0 |
| 2 | 04-05 | Full pipeline (TDD): `policies.py`, `freshness.py`, `context_assembler.py`, wired `POST /query` | 24 |
| 3 | 04-05 | Evaluation harness: `evaluator.py` + 8 corpus-grounded test queries | 40 |
| 4 | 04-05 | Corpus-relative freshness (time-independent scores, 0.5–1.0 range), half_life_days 30→365 | 46 |
| 5 | 04-06 | Commit & consolidation (no code changes) | 46 |
| 6 | 04-06 | Frontend redesign: "Midnight Analysis Desk" dark theme, result cards with score/freshness bars, tags, example query buttons, loading/error states | 46 |
| 7 | 04-10 | Pydantic contract layer: 13 typed models in `models.py`, 3 Protocol classes in `protocols.py` | 70 |
| 8 | 04-11 | Pipeline orchestrator: `pipeline.py` with StageOk/StageErr, 3 policy presets (`naive_top_k`, `permission_aware`, `full_policy`), rewired `main.py` | 88 |
| 9 | 04-11 | Typed stages in `src/stages/` (4 modules), `DecisionTrace` hardened (renamed fields, added `DroppedByBudget`, `ttft_proxy_ms`, `budget_utilization`) | 117 |
| 10 | 04-11 | Hybrid retrieval: FAISS + BM25 via RRF, 3× over-retrieval to compensate permission attrition | 137 |
| 11 | 04-12 | Evaluator wired to `run_pipeline()`, removed dead `token_budget` interface, trace-level metrics in evaluator output, legacy dict tests skipped (14) | 138 passed, 14 skipped |
| 12 | 04-12 | Context Policy Lab frontend: Single/Compare modes, `POST /compare` endpoint, structured Decision Trace rendering, 51/51 Playwright checks | 141 passed, 14 skipped |
| 13 | 04-12 | Hostile review clean verdict: empty-policies guard on `/compare`, strengthened compare tests | 142 passed, 14 skipped |
| 14 | 04-12 | `GET /evals` endpoint (cached), Evals dashboard (3rd frontend mode): 10 metric cards + 8-row per-query table | 148 passed, 14 skipped |
| 15 | 04-12 | Light theme migration (warm parchment palette), VP/Partner scenario buttons, freshness N/A fix, POLICY_META fallback fix, README rewrite | 148 passed, 14 skipped |
| 16 | 04-12 | Documentation pass: CLAUDE.md + plan updates (no code) | 148 passed, 14 skipped |
| 17 | 04-12 | Browser verification via Playwright: 44/44 checks, demo status READY | 148 passed, 14 skipped |

### Key Design Decisions (still relevant)

- **Corpus-relative freshness:** Age measured from newest doc in corpus (`2024-04-18`), not calendar date. Time-independent scores.
- **StageOk/StageErr pattern:** Pipeline aborts on first failure. Each stage is a pure-compute function with typed inputs/outputs.
- **3× over-retrieval:** `retrieve_k = policy.top_k * 3` compensates for permission attrition before budget packing.
- **RRF K=60:** Standard constant for fusing FAISS and BM25 ranks. Full-corpus ranking (12 docs is cheap).
- **Module-level `_evals_cache`:** `run_evals()` is ~5–10s cold; cache makes `/evals` usable from browser.
- **`ScoredDocument` uses `extra="ignore"`:** Absorbs extra keys (`rank`, `file_name`, `type`) from retriever without breaking validation.
- **14 legacy tests skipped:** `filter_by_role` (4), `apply_freshness` (5), `assemble()` (5) — all replaced by typed stages. Marked with `@_LEGACY_SKIP` or `pytestmark`.

### Dead Code (noted, not blocking)

- `apply_freshness()` in `freshness.py` — replaced by `stages/freshness_scorer.py`
- `filter_by_role()` in `policies.py` — replaced by `stages/permission_filter.py`
- `run_evals()` reloads roles/metadata independently of `main.py`'s copies — cosmetic, no correctness impact

### Persistent Environment Notes

- **Python 3.9.6 / LibreSSL 2.8.3:** `tf-keras` installed for `sentence-transformers` compatibility. Upgrading deps may break this.
- **Google Fonts:** Bricolage Grotesque + IBM Plex Mono from CDN; falls back to system fonts offline.

## Session — 2026-04-13 (Session 18 / Prompt 8: Final Hardening & Submission-Readiness)

### Summary

End-to-end reviewer pass across the full product experience. Four targeted fixes applied; one real bug (silent 500 on invalid policy for `/query`) caught and resolved. Browser verification confirmed all demo flows intact.

**What was done:**

1. **Fixed `/query` invalid-policy returns 500** (`src/main.py`) — `ValueError` raised by `resolve_policy()` inside `run_pipeline()` was not caught by the `/query` handler (only `/compare` had the `except ValueError` guard). Added `except ValueError as e: raise HTTPException(400, ...)` to `/query`. Before the fix: `POST /query` with `policy_name="bogus"` returned `500 Internal Server Error`. After: returns `400` with `"Unknown policy: 'bogus'. Valid policies: [...]"`.

2. **Added test for the above** (`tests/test_main.py`) — `test_query_invalid_policy_returns_400` added (tests: 17 → 18 total in that file; suite total: 148 → 149 passed).

3. **Fixed XSS in trace chip `title` attributes** (`frontend/app.js`) — Two `title="..."` attributes in `buildTracePanelHTML()` used unescaped API data:
   - Blocked chip: `title="requires: ${d.required_role}"` → `title="requires: ${escapeHTML(d.required_role)}"`
   - Stale chip: `title="superseded by: ${d.superseded_by} · ..."` → `title="superseded by: ${escapeHTML(d.superseded_by)} · ..."`
   (The `<em>` inline text in both chips was also fixed to use `escapeHTML`.)

4. **Fixed stale docstring in `src/protocols.py`** — `MetadataStoreProtocol` docstring still said "matches the shape that `freshness.apply_freshness` expects" — updated to reference `stages.freshness_scorer.score_freshness`, which is the actual live caller.

5. **Fixed stale comment in `src/freshness.py`** — `compute_freshness()` docstring said "In practice, `apply_freshness` passes the newest corpus date" — updated to "the stages layer passes the newest corpus date".

**Browser verification (Playwright, 65 checks):**

All 11 sections passed. 62/65 raw checks reported as passed; the 3 "failed" were test-script logic bugs (case-sensitive string comparisons against ALL-CAPS UI labels), confirmed as UI-correct in a targeted follow-up pass:
- Partner FULL column shows `"0\nBLOCKED"` (correct format; test checked wrong order)
- Evals "RECALL" label is ALL-CAPS (test checked mixed-case `"Recall"`)
- Evals "PERMISSION VIOLATIONS" label is ALL-CAPS (test checked `"Violation"` against `.lower()`)

**What was verified end-to-end:**
- Light theme: `rgb(245, 241, 234)` warm cream background
- Single mode: result cards, summary bar, relevance + freshness bars, tags, doc-id labels, Decision Trace expand/collapse, blocked chips, budget bar
- Naive policy: 12 `.metric-na` elements show "N/A — skipped by policy"; 0 freshness bars; 12 docs returned
- Analyst wall ↔: 3 compare columns (NAIVE/RBAC/FULL), 7 `flag-blocked` annotations, 3 open trace panels, analyst banner
- VP deal view ↔: 3 columns, VP role in banner
- Partner view ↔: 3 columns, partner banner, FULL column `"0\nBLOCKED"` confirmed
- Mode switching: Compare → Single, Evals → Single, all clean
- Evals dashboard: PRECISION@5=0.3000, RECALL=1.0000, PERMISSION VIOLATIONS=0.0%, 8-row table, "Queries run: 8 · Failed: 0"
- 0 JS console errors

### Current State

- **Branch:** `main`
- **Last commit:** `3d2738a` (Task 7B DONE)
- **Working tree:** 5 modified files (uncommitted — this session's work):
  - `frontend/app.js` — escapeHTML fixes on blocked + stale chip title attributes
  - `src/main.py` — `except ValueError` guard added to `/query`
  - `src/protocols.py` — stale docstring updated
  - `src/freshness.py` — stale comment updated
  - `tests/test_main.py` — `test_query_invalid_policy_returns_400` added
- **Tests:** 149 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (verified fresh run this session)
- **Evaluator:** precision@5=0.3000, recall=1.0000, permission_violation_rate=0% (verified fresh run this session)
- **Browser verification:** COMPLETE — 65/65 checks, 0 UI failures (3 false negatives were test-script bugs)
- **Hostile review:** `clean` (Prompt 7A — no new review this session; changes are targeted bug fixes only)
- **Demo status:** READY

### DOCX Scope Match

The project delivers the full promised scope of a **Permission-Aware Context Gateway / Context Policy Lab**:

| Deliverable | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Hybrid retrieval (FAISS semantic + BM25 lexical via RRF) | ✅ Done |
| RBAC permission filtering (analyst < vp < partner) | ✅ Done |
| Freshness scoring with stale-pair demotion (0.5× penalty) | ✅ Done |
| Token budget packing | ✅ Done |
| Full `DecisionTrace` audit (included/blocked/stale/dropped + metrics) | ✅ Done |
| Four policy presets (`naive_top_k`, `permission_aware`, `full_policy`, `default`) | ✅ Done |
| `POST /query` endpoint with policy selector | ✅ Done |
| `POST /compare` endpoint for side-by-side policy comparison | ✅ Done |
| `GET /evals` endpoint with cached evaluator results | ✅ Done |
| Three-mode frontend (Single / Compare / Evals) | ✅ Done |
| Three one-click compare scenarios (Analyst / VP / Partner) | ✅ Done |
| Evaluation harness (8 queries, P@5, recall, violation rate, trace metrics) | ✅ Done |

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Commit this batch** — 5 modified files: `frontend/app.js`, `src/main.py`, `src/protocols.py`, `src/freshness.py`, `tests/test_main.py`

2. **(Optional) Remove dead code** — `apply_freshness()` in `freshness.py` and `filter_by_role()` in `policies.py` are unreachable on the request path; 14 tests already skipped and labelled as legacy. Safe to delete when convenient; no urgency.

3. **(Optional) Evaluator corpus re-read** — `run_evals()` loads roles/metadata independently of `main.py`'s already-loaded copies. Cosmetic only; no correctness impact.

### Blockers and Warnings

None. Project is submission-ready.

- **Python 3.9 / LibreSSL:** System is 3.9.6 with LibreSSL 2.8.3. `tf-keras` installed for `sentence-transformers` compatibility on this Python version.
- **Google Fonts dependency:** Frontend loads Bricolage Grotesque and IBM Plex Mono from CDN; falls back to system fonts if offline.

### Suggested First Action

Commit the 5 modified files. No further work is required before submission.

## Session — 2026-04-15 (Session 19 / **MUST-A — IDEA 2 + IDEA 1**)

> **IDEA numbering convention:** Prompts labelled "IDEA N" track discrete feature/enrichment batches applied after the core build. Batches labelled "MUST-X" group multiple IDEAs into a single commit unit.

### Summary

**Batch label: MUST-A — IDEA 2 + IDEA 1**

Two enrichment passes in one session: backend metadata plumbing (IDEA 2) followed by frontend policy-selector polish (IDEA 1), plus a targeted visual review/rescue pass on the policy-selection block.

---

#### IDEA 2 — Enrich DocumentChunk with Metadata

Propagated `title`, `doc_type`, `date`, and `superseded_by` through the full data chain so the frontend `context[]` array receives those fields on every response. No business logic changed. No tests added or removed.

**Files modified (5):**

1. **`src/retriever.py`** — `_build_results()` now emits `"doc_type": p.get("type")` in addition to the existing `"type"` key. `ScoredDocument` uses `extra="ignore"` so `"type"` was always silently dropped; `doc_type` is the correctly-named key that the model picks up.

2. **`src/models.py`** — Four model additions, all `Optional[str] = None`:
   - `ScoredDocument`: added `doc_type`
   - `FreshnessScoredDocument`: added `doc_type`
   - `IncludedDocument`: added `title`, `doc_type`, `date`, `superseded_by`
   - `DocumentChunk`: added `title`, `doc_type`, `date`, `superseded_by`

3. **`src/stages/freshness_scorer.py`** — `FreshnessScoredDocument(...)` constructor now passes `doc_type=doc.doc_type`.

4. **`src/stages/budget_packer.py`** — `IncludedDocument(...)` constructor now passes `title`, `doc_type`, `date`, `superseded_by`.

5. **`src/main.py`** — Both `DocumentChunk(...)` constructors (in `query()` and `compare()`) now pass `title`, `doc_type`, `date`, `superseded_by` from `inc`.

---

#### IDEA 1 — Improve Policy Names + Policy Description Area

Frontend-only visual changes to the policy selector. No backend changes.

**Files modified (3):**

1. **`frontend/app.js`** — `POLICY_META` labels updated:
   - `naive_top_k`: `"NAIVE"` → `"No Filters"`, desc updated to full sentence
   - `permission_aware`: `"RBAC"` → `"Permissions Only"`, desc updated
   - `full_policy`: `"FULL"` → `"Full Pipeline"`, desc updated
   - **Bug fix:** `permission_aware.skipFreshness` changed from `false` → `true` (backend skips freshness for this policy; was showing `0.00` bars instead of N/A)
   - Added `updatePolicyDescription()` function with 80ms opacity fade transition
   - Event listeners wired to all `[name="policy"]` radios; init call on page load

2. **`frontend/index.html`** — `#single-policy-selector` restructured:
   - Outer wrapper: new class `policy-selector-group` (flex-column container)
   - Inner `.selector-group` div: holds label + chips horizontally
   - `<p id="policy-description">` added below chips — shows `POLICY_META.desc` for selected policy
   - `<div id="policy-warning" hidden>` added — amber banner with ⚠ icon, shown only when "No Filters" is selected
   - Chip labels: `naive` → `No Filters`, `rbac` → `Permissions Only`, `full` → `Full Pipeline`

3. **`frontend/styles.css`** — New rules added:
   - `.policy-selector-group`: `flex-direction: column; align-self: flex-start` (prevents vertical misalignment against shorter Role group in `.controls-row`)
   - `.policy-description`: mono, `0.61rem`, tertiary color, `opacity 80ms` transition
   - `.policy-warning`: `rgba(251,191,36,0.13)` background, amber left border, compact padding
   - `.policy-warning > span`: `flex-shrink: 0; line-height: 1` (emoji alignment fix)

---

#### Visual Review Pass (policy-selection block only)

A targeted `/frontend-design` review of the policy selector hierarchy. Five polish fixes applied:

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 1 | `.controls-row { align-items: center }` misaligned Role and Policy chips when Policy group grew taller | `align-self: flex-start` on `.policy-selector-group` |
| 2 | ⚠ emoji floated high on some systems | `.policy-warning > span { flex-shrink: 0; line-height: 1 }` |
| 3 | `padding-left: 0.1rem` on description (meaningless 1.6px) | Removed |
| 4 | Warning background 10% opacity nearly invisible on parchment | Bumped to 13% |
| 5 | `transition: opacity` declared in CSS but never fired in JS | Added 80ms fade in `updatePolicyDescription()` |

---

**Note:** `roadmap.md` was deleted before this session (shows `D` in git status). No further work items are carried forward from it.

### Current State

- **Branch:** `main`
- **Last commit:** `78cdaf1` (WIP: MUST-A idea 1 and 2)
- **Working tree:** Clean (all MUST-A changes committed)
- **Tests:** 149 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (verified this session)
- **Evaluator:** precision@5=0.3000, recall=1.0000, permission_violation_rate=0% (unchanged)
- **Browser verification:** PENDING — IDEA 1 and IDEA 2 changes have not been visually verified in-browser. Last full verification was Session 18 (65/65 Playwright checks). The policy description area, warning banner, N/A freshness fix for `permission_aware`, and new chip labels are unverified.
- **Hostile review:** Not performed this session (last verdict: `clean`, Session 18)
- **Demo status:** READY (backend: no regressions; frontend: unverified but low-risk — all new fields are Optional, all label changes are display-only)

### What MUST-A Unblocks

- Frontend work that consumes `title`, `doc_type`, `date`, or `superseded_by` from `context[]` can proceed without additional backend changes.
- The policy selector now has product-grade labels and descriptions; compare-mode column headers inherit these automatically via `POLICY_META`.
- `permission_aware` freshness now correctly renders as N/A in both Single and Compare modes.

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Browser-verify MUST-A** — Confirm policy description area, warning banner, N/A freshness for `permission_aware`, and new chip labels render correctly in Single and Compare modes.
2. **(Optional) Remove dead code** — `apply_freshness()` in `freshness.py` and `filter_by_role()` in `policies.py` are unreachable on the request path; 14 tests already skipped. Safe to delete; no urgency.
3. **(Optional) Evaluator corpus re-read** — `run_evals()` loads roles/metadata independently of `main.py`'s copies. Cosmetic; no correctness impact.

### Suggested First Action

Browser-verify the MUST-A frontend changes before starting MUST-B1.

---

## Session — 2026-04-16 (Session 20 / **MUST-B1 — IDEA 3 + IDEA 7**)

> **IDEA numbering convention:** Batches labelled "MUST-X" group multiple IDEAs into a single commit unit.

### Summary

**Batch label: MUST-B1 — IDEA 3 + IDEA 7**

Three passes in one session: MUST-A browser verification, IDEA 3 (card redesign), and IDEA 7 (stale/superseded badges). All frontend-only — no backend, no test, no model changes.

---

#### MUST-A Browser Verification (completed this session)

Confirmed all MUST-A changes correct via Playwright (20/20 checks):
- Policy chips show "No Filters" / "Permissions Only" / "Full Pipeline" (old NAIVE/RBAC/FULL gone)
- Policy description updates on radio switch; all three descriptions are distinct
- Amber warning banner appears only for No Filters
- Permissions Only freshness renders as "N/A — skipped by policy" (12 elements); no 0.00 bars
- Full Pipeline query returns result cards; trace panel expands correctly
- 0 JS console errors

---

#### IDEA 3 — Document Card Redesign + Excerpt Expand/Collapse

Frontend-only. No backend or test changes.

**Files modified (2):** `frontend/app.js`, `frontend/styles.css`

**`singleCardHTML` changes:**
- Card header now shows document `title` (fallback: `doc_id`) as main heading (`.card-title`) with rank on the right
- New `.card-meta` line below title: `doc_id` badge (`.card-meta-badge`, light gray bg, mono font) · formatted doc type (e.g. "Public Filing") · formatted date (e.g. "Mar 2024")
- Default excerpt shortened from 480 → 200 chars
- Expand/collapse button ("Show more ▾" / "Hide ▴") toggles to full ~500-char indexer excerpt
- **Security hardening:** raw content stored in `_cardExcerpts` Map keyed by `data-card-idx`; toggle uses `textContent`, not `innerHTML` from data attributes
- **Date timezone fix:** `new Date(dateStr)` → manual `new Date(year, month-1, 1)` to avoid UTC offset shifting months (e.g. "2024-03-01" was rendering as "Feb 2024")

**`buildCompareCardHTML` changes:**
- Title heading (`.compare-card-title`, truncated to 60 chars) replaces bare doc_id
- Same `.card-meta` line (badge + type + date) added below title
- Snippet shortened from 160 → 120 chars
- No expand button (columns are narrow)

**New CSS:** `.card-title`, `.card-meta`, `.card-meta-badge`, `.compare-card-title`, `.card-content` (max-height transition: collapsed 4.8em → expanded 600px), `.card-content-text`, `.card-expand-btn`, `.compare-card-meta`

**New JS helpers:** `formatDocType(raw)`, `formatDate(dateStr)`, `_cardExcerpts` Map, `wireExpandButtons(container)`

---

#### IDEA 7 — Stale/Superseded Badge

Frontend-only. No backend or test changes.

**Files modified (2):** `frontend/app.js`, `frontend/styles.css`

**Detection:** Two-method with fallback:
- **Primary (Option A):** `chunk.superseded_by != null` — available because IDEA 2 already propagates this field through the full chain
- **Fallback (Option B):** cross-reference `chunk.doc_id` against `trace.demoted_as_stale` (built into a `staleMap` in `renderSingleResult()`)

**Single mode badge (`.stale-badge`):** Amber-tinted box with ⚠ icon, "Superseded by **doc_XXX** — freshness penalized 0.5×". Inserted between `.card-meta` and `.card-content`. Penalty value pulled from `staleInfo.penalty_applied` (falls back to `0.5×`).

**Compare mode badge (`.compare-stale-badge`):** Compact inline "⚠ Superseded" chip (option A only — `doc.superseded_by != null`). Inserted between `.card-meta` and content snippet.

**New CSS:** `.stale-badge`, `.stale-icon`, `.stale-text`, `.stale-text strong`, `.compare-stale-badge`

---

### Current State

- **Branch:** `codex/must-a-idea1-2`
- **Last commit:** `719e03f` (MUST-A idea 1 and 2) — MUST-B1 changes are **uncommitted** (2 modified files)
- **Working tree:** 2 modified files (uncommitted — this session's work):
  - `frontend/app.js` — IDEA 3 + IDEA 7 changes
  - `frontend/styles.css` — IDEA 3 + IDEA 7 styles
- **Tests:** 149 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (verified this session — `python3 -m pytest -q`)
- **Evaluator:** precision@5=0.3000, recall=1.0000, permission_violation_rate=0% (unchanged; no pipeline changes)
- **Browser verification:** COMPLETE — 19/19 MUST-B1 Playwright checks passed (IDEA 3 × 8, IDEA 7 × 5, Compare × 4, Evals regression × 1, JS errors × 1). 0 JS console errors.
- **Hostile review:** Not performed this session (last clean verdict: Session 18)
- **Demo status:** READY (all three modes functional; stale badges correct on both known stale pairs)

### Stale Docs Updated This Session

- **`CLAUDE.md` frontend section** — updated Single mode and Compare mode descriptions to reflect card redesign (title, metadata line, excerpt expand/collapse) and stale badges. Previously described card rendering did not mention these fields.
- **`docs/plans/2026-04-10-pipeline-integration-plan.md`** — historical/archived; no update needed. All items have been complete since Session 16.

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Commit MUST-B1** — 2 modified files: `frontend/app.js`, `frontend/styles.css`
2. **(Optional) Remove dead code** — `apply_freshness()` in `freshness.py` and `filter_by_role()` in `policies.py` are unreachable on the request path; 14 tests already skipped. Safe to delete; no urgency.
3. **(Optional) Evaluator corpus re-read** — `run_evals()` loads roles/metadata independently of `main.py`'s copies. Cosmetic; no correctness impact.

### Blockers and Warnings

None. Backend is unchanged. All new frontend fields are `Optional` — no risk of null-pointer regressions.

- **Branch mismatch note:** Working branch is `codex/must-a-idea1-2`, not `main`. MUST-A and MUST-B1 work lives here. Merge/PR decision is deferred.
- **Python 3.9 / LibreSSL:** System is 3.9.6 with LibreSSL 2.8.3. `tf-keras` installed for `sentence-transformers` compatibility.

### Suggested First Action

Commit the 2 modified files (`frontend/app.js`, `frontend/styles.css`) as the MUST-B1 batch.

---

## Session — 2026-04-16 (Session 21 / **MUST-B2 — IDEA 5**)

> **IDEA numbering convention:** Batches labelled "MUST-X" group multiple IDEAs into a single commit unit.

### Summary

**Batch label: MUST-B2 — IDEA 5**

One enrichment pass: backend `BlockedDocument` metadata plumbing + frontend collapsible blocked-documents section in Single mode.

---

#### IDEA 5 — Blocked Documents Section in Single Mode

**Backend (2 files modified):**

1. **`src/models.py`** — `BlockedDocument` gained two optional fields:
   - `title: Optional[str] = None`
   - `doc_type: Optional[str] = None`

2. **`src/stages/permission_filter.py`** — Both `BlockedDocument(...)` constructors (unknown-role path and insufficient-role path) now pass `title=doc.title, doc_type=doc.doc_type`.

**Frontend (2 files modified):**

3. **`frontend/app.js`** — Three additions:
   - `buildBlockedSectionHTML(blocked, userRole)` — returns `<section class="blocked-section">` with a collapsible header ("🔒 N document(s) blocked by permissions ▾") and body with per-document `.blocked-card` entries showing title (fallback to `doc_id`), `doc_id` badge, doc type, and a human-readable reason (`"Requires X role — you are Y"` for `insufficient_role`; `"Unknown role requirement: X"` for `unknown_min_role`). Section omitted entirely when `blocked` is empty.
   - `wireBlockedSectionToggle(container)` — toggles `.open` class on `.blocked-section` header click.
   - `renderSingleResult()` updated: `blockedSectionHTML` computed from `trace?.blocked_by_permission || []` and inserted between `cardsHTML` and `traceHTML`.

4. **`frontend/styles.css`** — New block `/* ─── Blocked Documents Section (single mode) ─── */`:
   - `.blocked-section`, `.blocked-header` (amber left border `var(--trace-blocked)`, `var(--trace-blocked-bg)` background), `.blocked-header-icon`, `.blocked-caret` (rotates 180° when `.open`), `.blocked-body` (max-height 0 → 2000px transition), `.blocked-body-inner`, `.blocked-card`, `.blocked-card-title`, `.blocked-card-meta`, `.blocked-card-reason`.

1. **Commit MUST-B1 + MUST-B2** — 4 modified files: `frontend/app.js`, `frontend/styles.css`, `src/models.py`, `src/stages/permission_filter.py`
2. **(Optional) Remove dead code** — `apply_freshness()` in `freshness.py` and `filter_by_role()` in `policies.py` are unreachable on the request path; 14 tests already skipped. Safe to delete; no urgency.
3. **(Optional) Evaluator corpus re-read** — `run_evals()` loads roles/metadata independently of `main.py`'s copies. Cosmetic; no correctness impact.

### Blockers and Warnings

None. All new backend fields are `Optional` — existing tests unaffected. Frontend section is conditionally rendered (no display when zero blocked).

- **Branch mismatch note:** Working branch is `codex/must-a-idea1-2`, not `main`. MUST-A + MUST-B1 + MUST-B2 work lives here. Merge/PR decision is deferred.
- **Python 3.9 / LibreSSL:** System is 3.9.6 with LibreSSL 2.8.3. `tf-keras` installed for `sentence-transformers` compatibility.

### Suggested First Action

Commit the 4 modified files as a combined MUST-B1 + MUST-B2 batch (or as two sequential commits if separate provenance is preferred).

## Session — 2026-04-16 (Session 22 / **MUST-B2 Verification + Documentation Pass**)

### Summary

Documentation and verification pass only. No code changes made. Confirmed MUST-B1 was committed as `6ac80a6` (correcting the Session 21 state which incorrectly described it as uncommitted). Ran `python3 -m pytest -q` and a thorough 7-criterion Playwright verification of the MUST-B2 blocked-documents section.

---

#### What was verified

**Tests (`python3 -m pytest -q`):** 149 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed.

**Browser verification (7/7 Playwright checks — expanded from Session 21's 4/4):**

| # | Criterion | Result |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Analyst + ARR query → blocked section appears (N > 0) | ✅ Header: "7 documents blocked by permissions" |
| 2 | Section collapsed by default | ✅ Body height = 0 on load |
| 3 | Click header → expands, blocked cards visible | ✅ 7 cards rendered |
| 4 | Blocked card reason is human-readable | ✅ "Requires vp role — you are analyst" |
| 5 | Click header again → collapses | ✅ Confirmed collapsed |
| 6 | Partner + same query → NO blocked section | ✅ `blocked-section` count = 0 |
| 7 | No JS console errors | ✅ 0 errors |

**Additive-only checks (all confirmed):**
- `buildBlockedSectionHTML` returns `""` when blocked list is empty — section is never rendered for partner or zero-blocked cases.
- No document content, excerpts, or scores are exposed in the blocked section — only `doc_id`, `title`, `doc_type`, and the reason string.

---

#### Stale docs corrected this session

- **`docs/HANDOFF.md` Session 21 "Current State"** — said last commit was `719e03f` and MUST-B1 was uncommitted. Corrected here: MUST-B1 was committed as `6ac80a6` before this session. MUST-B2 code remains uncommitted.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — already fully up to date (lines 94, 135 describe MUST-B2 correctly). No changes needed.
- **`docs/plans/2026-04-10-pipeline-integration-plan.md`** — historical/archived. All plan items complete since Session 16. No update needed.

## Session — 2026-04-16 (Session 23 / **IDEAs Follow-up Closure — P2 + P3**)

### Summary

Documentation-only pass. Closed the two remaining follow-up items from `docs/plans/2026-04-16-ideas-execution-plan.md`. No code, test, or product changes.

**P2 — Restore flow consolidation (resolved):**
Added a 6-line `[ARCHIVED — 2026-04-16]` banner to the header of `docs/plans/2026-04-10-pipeline-integration-plan.md`. The banner explicitly states the file is not part of the default restore flow, kept on disk as audit record only, and documents the canonical restore sequence: `HANDOFF.md` → `CLAUDE.md` (extended: + `docs/plans/2026-04-16-ideas-execution-plan.md`).

**P3 — Compare column-header label verification (resolved):**
Ran an explicit Playwright assertion via the `webapp-testing` skill:
- Loaded `frontend/index.html` (file://) with the uvicorn API server running on port 8000
- Clicked the "Analyst wall ↔" scenario button (auto-switches to Compare mode, fires `POST /compare`)
- Waited for `.col-badge` elements; asserted exactly 3 present with text in order

```
Found 3 .col-badge elements: ['No Filters', 'Permissions Only', 'Full Pipeline']
PASS — Compare column headers match expected labels exactly.
```

This closes the lone `unclear` item from the MUST-A IDEA 1 consistency review. The code path was correct by construction (`buildCompareColumnHTML` reads `POLICY_META[policyName].label`), but the assertion was never itemized explicitly until now.

**Execution plan updated:** Both P2 and P3 entries rewritten as resolved with evidence. Count line updated to `P0=0, P1=0, P2=0 (resolved), P3=0 (resolved). All follow-ups closed.`

---

### Current State

- **Branch:** `codex/must-a-idea1-2`
- **Last commit:** `6122d94` (MUST-B2) — all subsequent changes are doc-only and uncommitted
- **Working tree — uncommitted doc files:**
  - `docs/HANDOFF.md` — this session entry
  - `docs/plans/2026-04-10-pipeline-integration-plan.md` — ARCHIVED banner added (P2)
  - `docs/plans/2026-04-16-ideas-execution-plan.md` — new canonical plan file (untracked; replaces deleted summary)
  - `docs/plans/2026-04-16-ideas-1-2-3-5-7-execution-summary.md` — deleted (unstaged; superseded by execution plan)
- **Tests:** 149 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (last verified Session 22; no code touched this session)
- **Evaluator:** precision@5=0.3000, recall=1.0000, permission_violation_rate=0% (unchanged)
- **Browser verification:** P3 assertion PASS (this session)
- **Demo status:** READY
- **IDEAs follow-up thread:** FULLY CLOSED — `docs/plans/2026-04-16-ideas-execution-plan.md` is the canonical artifact; all P-items resolved

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Commit doc cleanup** — 4 files: `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/plans/2026-04-10-pipeline-integration-plan.md` (modified), `docs/plans/2026-04-16-ideas-execution-plan.md` (new, untracked), `docs/plans/2026-04-16-ideas-1-2-3-5-7-execution-summary.md` (deleted)
2. **(Optional) Remove dead code** — `apply_freshness()` in `freshness.py` and `filter_by_role()` in `policies.py` are unreachable; 14 tests already skipped. Safe to delete; no urgency.
3. **(Optional) Evaluator corpus re-read** — `run_evals()` loads roles/metadata independently of `main.py`'s copies. Cosmetic; no correctness impact.

### Blockers and Warnings

None. The IDEAs follow-up thread has no open items. No code was touched.

- **Branch note:** Working branch is `codex/must-a-idea1-2`, not `main`. All MUST-A/B1/B2 work plus doc cleanup lives here. Merge/PR decision is deferred.
- **Python 3.9 / LibreSSL:** System is 3.9.6 with LibreSSL 2.8.3. `tf-keras` installed for `sentence-transformers` compatibility.

### Suggested First Action

Commit the 4 uncommitted doc files as a single "doc cleanup" commit.

---

## Session — 2026-04-17 (Session 24 / **MUST-C — IDEA 4 + IDEA 6**)

### Summary

**Batch label: MUST-C — IDEA 4 + IDEA 6**

Two frontend-only explainability passes. No backend, test, or model changes. All added UI is additive and conditionally rendered; existing chips, tables, and layouts untouched.

---

#### IDEA 4 — Natural-language Decision Trace summary + metric tooltips

**Files modified (2):** `frontend/app.js`, `frontend/styles.css`

- **`buildTraceSummary(trace, userRole, compact)`** helper added above `buildTracePanelHTML`. Returns an HTML string composed of up to four sentences — included / blocked / stale / dropped — with conditional rules (blocked and stale omitted when counts are zero; dropped omitted in compact mode when zero). Grammatical guards for `included === 0` and singular/plural nouns. `<strong>` used for emphasis on counts, roles, and doc IDs. All interpolated values pass through `escapeHTML`.
- **`buildTracePanelHTML(trace, startOpen, userRole)`** signature extended with `userRole`. Inserts `<div class="trace-summary">` as the first child of `.trace-body`. Adds `trace-summary-compact` class when `startOpen === true` (Compare mode). The compact variant collapses the stale clause to a one-line count and drops the zero-dropped sentence.
- **Four tooltips** added via `title=` attributes: `.budget-label` (Budget), and three spans in `.trace-numbers` (avg score, avg freshness, ttft). Prompt typos corrected: `"gng" → "generating"`, `"rey" → "recency"`.
- **Call sites threaded:** `renderSingleResult` passes `role`; `buildCompareColumnHTML` signature extended with `userRole` and forwards it; `renderCompare` passes `data.role` into each column.
- **CSS:** new `.trace-summary` (accent left border, `bg-surface`, readable `text-primary`) + `.trace-summary-compact` (tighter padding/size for Compare columns) + `.trace-summary strong`.

Compact-mode rule choice: instead of stripping the budget-% clause, the compact variant drops the zero-dropped sentence and collapses per-doc stale details to a count. This preserves the informative "N tokens, M% of budget" clause in all modes while visibly shortening the paragraph on small columns.

---

#### IDEA 6 — Evals narrative banner + per-card hints + query-text column

**Files modified (2):** `frontend/app.js`, `frontend/styles.css`

- **`buildEvalsNarrative(agg)`** helper added below `renderEvals`. Returns `<div class="evals-narrative">` with three sentences: (1) permission-violations line (congratulatory or warning form); (2) recall line (100% form or fallback for less-than-perfect recall); (3) budget-utilization tier line (`< 0.60 → efficient`, `[0.60, 0.80] → moderate`, `> 0.80 → heavy`). Guarded on `queries_run > 0` — returns empty string otherwise.
- **`METRIC_HINTS`** added inline as a `hint` field on each card entry in `renderEvals`. Each `.metric-card` now renders three spans: label / value / hint. Typos from prompt fixed.
- **Query cell redesign:** the per-query table's first cell now contains `<span class="evals-qid">${q.id}</span><span class="evals-qtext" title="${full}">${truncated}</span>`, with truncation at 50 chars + `…`. Existing 12-column layout preserved; `.evals-query-cell` allows wrapping (overrides the global `white-space: nowrap` on `td`). Full query text surfaced via `title=` tooltip.
- **CSS:** new `.evals-narrative` (parchment card with accent left border + shadow), `.metric-card-hint` (small tertiary text as third flex child; no grid disruption), `.evals-query-cell` / `.evals-qid` (accent pill) / `.evals-qtext` (display-font, secondary color).

---

### Current State

- **Branch:** `codex/must-a-idea1-2`
- **Last commit:** `2d58d05` (MUST-B2 DOCS) — MUST-C changes are **uncommitted** (2 modified files + 1 new plan doc)
- **Working tree:**
  - `frontend/app.js` (modified) — IDEA 4 + IDEA 6
  - `frontend/styles.css` (modified) — IDEA 4 + IDEA 6 styles
  - `docs/plans/2026-04-17-must-c-ideas-4-6-plan.md` (new, untracked) — the approved batch plan
- **Tests:** 149 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (fresh run this session)
- **Evaluator:** fresh `python3 -m src.evaluator` run this session matches baseline — **precision@5=0.3000, recall=1.0000, permission_violation_rate=0%**, queries run 8/8, avg budget util 53%, avg freshness 0.768. No pipeline changed.
- **Browser verification:** COMPLETE — **15/15 Playwright checks passed** (IDEA 4 × 8 incl. separate analyst/partner blocked-clause checks; IDEA 6 × 7). 0 JS console errors across Single, Compare, and Evals modes.
- **JS syntax:** `node --check frontend/app.js` → OK.
- **Hostile review:** not performed this session (last clean verdict: Session 18)
- **Demo status:** READY

### Stale Docs Updated This Session

- **`CLAUDE.md` frontend section** — Single, Compare, and Evals mode descriptions amended to mention the trace narrative paragraph + tooltips (Single/Compare) and the narrative banner + card hints + query text column (Evals).
- **`docs/plans/2026-04-16-ideas-execution-plan.md`** — not modified. MUST-C is a separate batch with its own canonical plan; the 2026-04-16 plan remains the canonical MUST-A/B1/B2 artifact.
- **`docs/plans/2026-04-10-pipeline-integration-plan.md`** — ARCHIVED; not touched.

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Commit MUST-C** — 3 files: `frontend/app.js`, `frontend/styles.css`, `docs/plans/2026-04-17-must-c-ideas-4-6-plan.md`, plus `docs/HANDOFF.md` + `CLAUDE.md` for this session's doc updates.
2. **(Optional) Remove dead code** — `apply_freshness()` in `freshness.py` and `filter_by_role()` in `policies.py` are unreachable; 14 tests already skipped. Safe to delete; no urgency.
3. **(Optional) Evaluator corpus re-read** — `run_evals()` loads roles/metadata independently of `main.py`'s copies. Cosmetic; no correctness impact.

### Blockers and Warnings

None. All additions are conditional (narrative guarded on `queries_run > 0`; summary emits only non-empty clauses). `userRole` threading has default-undefined fallback; missing role degrades gracefully (the blocked clause uses generic phrasing).

- **Branch note:** Working branch is `codex/must-a-idea1-2`. MUST-A + MUST-B1 + MUST-B2 + MUST-C all live here.
- **Python 3.9 / LibreSSL:** System is 3.9.6 with LibreSSL 2.8.3. `tf-keras` installed for `sentence-transformers` compatibility.

### Suggested First Action

Commit the MUST-C batch (2 frontend files + new plan doc + this HANDOFF update + CLAUDE.md update).

---

## Session — 2026-04-17 (Session 25 / **MUST-D — IDEA 8 · PDF Ingestion + Admin Panel**)

### Summary

**Batch label: MUST-D — IDEA 8**

First backend-expanding batch since MUST-A. Adds a runtime PDF ingestion path (new `POST /ingest` endpoint, new `src/ingest.py`, new frontend Admin mode) plus two new runtime dependencies. Writes to `corpus/documents/`, `corpus/metadata.json`, and `artifacts/*` at request time. 23 new tests.

---

#### Backend (6 files)

1. **`requirements.txt`** — added `pdfplumber` and `python-multipart`.

2. **`src/ingest.py` (new, ~210 lines)** — orchestrator `ingest_document(pdf_bytes, title, date, min_role, doc_type, sensitivity, tags, superseded_by=None, metadata_path=None, corpus_dir=None)` plus helpers `extract_text_from_pdf`, `generate_next_doc_id`, `sanitize_filename`, `_validate_inputs`, `_unique_filename`. Module-level `threading.Lock` (`_INGEST_LOCK`) wraps doc_id generation + `.txt` write + metadata append + `indexer.build_and_save()` call. Enum sets mirror existing corpus values: `VALID_MIN_ROLES={analyst,vp,partner}`, `VALID_DOC_TYPES={10 values}`, `VALID_SENSITIVITY={low,medium,high,confidential}`. `IngestError(ValueError)` carries a `status_code` attribute for clean FastAPI mapping. `MAX_PDF_BYTES=10*1024*1024`, `MIN_EXTRACTED_CHARS=50`. `metadata_path` / `corpus_dir` default to `None` with runtime fallback to module-level constants — enables monkeypatching in tests.

3. **`src/retriever.py`** — new `invalidate_caches()` resets only the `_bm25` singleton (FAISS is re-read from disk per request, embeddings model is corpus-independent).

4. **`src/models.py`** — new `IngestResponse(BaseModel)` with `extra="forbid"`: `status`, `doc_id`, `title`, `file_name`, `type`, `date`, `min_role`, `sensitivity`, `tags`, `total_documents`.

5. **`src/main.py`** — new `POST /ingest` handler. Maps `UploadFile` + 6 `Form(...)` fields → `ingest_document()`. Catches `IngestError` → `HTTPException(e.status_code)`. Rejects non-PDF content-types with 415 before calling ingest. On success, mutates `_metadata["documents"]` in place (so `run_pipeline` closures see the update), clears `_evals_cache`, and calls `retriever.invalidate_caches()`.

6. **`tests/test_ingest.py` (new, 23 tests)** — `sanitize_filename` (basic/nonword/path-traversal/empty/length-cap), `generate_next_doc_id` (advance/empty/malformed), `extract_text_from_pdf` (empty/unreadable), `ingest_document` validation (oversize 413, bad-date, bad-role, bad-doc_type, bad-sensitivity, empty-title), happy path (tmp_path + monkeypatched `indexer.build_and_save` + monkeypatched `extract_text_from_pdf`), duplicate-filename suffix. Five endpoint tests via `TestClient`: 415/400/400/422 error paths plus happy-path with patched `ingest_document` + `invalidate_caches` verifying response shape and that `_evals_cache is None` after the call.

---

#### Frontend (3 files)

7. **`frontend/index.html`** — fourth `<button data-mode="admin">Admin</button>` in the mode-toggle; new `<section id="admin-section" hidden>` with file / title / date / min_role select (3 values) / doc_type select (10 values) / sensitivity select (4 values) / tags inputs, submit button with spinner, status div, and demo-only advisory note.

8. **`frontend/app.js`** — `adminSection` DOM ref; `switchMode` branch for `isAdmin` (hides search, results, admin when appropriate); `setAdminStatus` / `clearAdminStatus` / `uploadDocument(event)` helpers. `uploadDocument` POSTs `FormData` to `${API_BASE}/ingest`, disables the submit button with `.loading` during the call, then renders success/error via `escapeHTML`-hardened status messages.

9. **`frontend/styles.css`** — `.admin-section`, `.admin-form`, `.admin-row` (grid), `.admin-field`, `.admin-btn` with spinner, `.admin-status-loading/success/error` colored left borders, `.admin-note`, responsive `@media (max-width: 640px)` fallback.

---

### Verification

**Tests:** 172 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (`python3 -m pytest -q`). 23 new tests vs. 149 baseline.

**Server smoke:** `python3 -m uvicorn src.main:app --port 8000` → `/docs` responds 200. Clean startup, no regressions.

**curl end-to-end:**

| Case | Request | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| 415 — non-PDF | `text/plain` upload | `415 {"detail":"Expected a PDF upload; got content-type 'text/plain'."}` |
| 400 — bad role | `min_role=god` | `400 {"detail":"min_role must be one of ['analyst', 'partner', 'vp']."}` |
| 400 — bad date | `date=05/01/2024` | `400 {"detail":"date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format."}` |
| 422 — unreadable PDF | `%PDF-` only | `422 {"detail":"Unreadable PDF: No /Root object! - Is this really a PDF?"}` |
| 413 — oversize | 10 MB + 100 bytes | `413 {"detail":"PDF exceeds 10 MB size limit."}` |
| 200 — happy path | real reportlab PDF | `200 {"status":"ok","doc_id":"doc_013","file_name":"verification_smoke_doc.txt","total_documents":13,...}` |

**Search-after-ingest:** `POST /query {"query":"LIMINAL_ECHO_SENTINEL_7742","role":"analyst","top_k":5}` → `doc_013` ranked #1 in context. Cache invalidation + reindex confirmed working end-to-end.

**Playwright Admin flow (via `webapp-testing` skill):** Loaded frontend via `file://` with uvicorn on :8000 for the API. Clicked Admin tab → filled all fields → `set_input_files('/tmp/real.pdf')` → clicked Upload. Status area reached `admin-status-success` class with text: `"Indexed doc_014 — Playwright Admin Flow Doc. Corpus now contains 14 documents. It is searchable in Single and Compare modes."`. PASS.

**Rollback:** Corpus restored to pre-test state (12 docs, 12 `.txt` files, `artifacts/*` restored from snapshots).

---

### Current State

- **Branch:** `codex/must-a-idea1-2`
- **Last commit:** `3da04cd` (MUST-D docs follow-up) on top of `a6d1daa` (MUST-D: IDEA 8 — PDF ingestion + Admin panel)
- **Working tree:** clean. All 12 MUST-D files (9 code + 3 doc) landed in `a6d1daa`; `3da04cd` is a docs-only follow-up commit. No modified, staged, or untracked files remain at handoff time.
- **Files in the MUST-D commit (`a6d1daa`, 12 files, +1323 / −11):**
  - Code: `requirements.txt`, `src/ingest.py` (new), `src/retriever.py`, `src/models.py`, `src/main.py`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/app.js`, `frontend/styles.css`, `tests/test_ingest.py` (new)
  - Docs: `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/plans/2026-04-17-must-d-idea-8-plan.md` (new)
- **Tests:** 172 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (this session)
- **Evaluator:** unchanged on the original 12-doc corpus (no pipeline logic changed)
- **Browser verification:** COMPLETE — Admin flow end-to-end PASS; prior MUST-C Playwright coverage unchanged
- **Hostile review:** Not performed this session (last clean verdict: Session 18)
- **Demo status:** READY

### Stale Docs Updated This Session

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — added `POST /ingest` endpoint section, Admin mode bullet under Frontend, `IngestResponse` in Contract models key types, dependency note under Environment note. `Three modes controlled by a header toggle:` → `Four modes controlled by a header toggle:`.
- **`docs/plans/2026-04-17-must-d-idea-8-plan.md`** — kept as the canonical MUST-D artifact; no content rewrite needed (plan matches execution).
- **`docs/plans/2026-04-16-ideas-execution-plan.md`** — unchanged. Different batch scope.
- **`docs/plans/2026-04-17-must-c-ideas-4-6-plan.md`** — unchanged. Different batch.

### Remaining Tasks

No MUST-D work remains. The batch is fully implemented, verified, and committed (`a6d1daa` + `3da04cd`). All long-standing optional follow-ups from prior sessions are unchanged and still optional:

1. **(Optional) Remove dead code** — `apply_freshness()` in `freshness.py` and `filter_by_role()` in `policies.py` remain unreachable; 14 tests skipped. Safe to delete; no urgency.
2. **(Optional) Evaluator corpus re-read** — unchanged from prior sessions; cosmetic.
3. **(Optional) Deploy posture** — if hosting the demo, note the ephemeral-fs limitation: uploads via `/ingest` will not survive container restarts on most hosts.
4. **(Optional) Hostile review** — last clean verdict was Session 18; MUST-A/B/C/D have not been rereviewed. No known issues.

### Blockers and Warnings

None. All validation boundaries covered by tests. The only persistent-state mutation (`metadata.json` + `artifacts/*`) is serialized by `_INGEST_LOCK` and restorable from git.

- **Branch note:** Working branch is `codex/must-a-idea1-2`. MUST-A + MUST-B1 + MUST-B2 + MUST-C + MUST-D all live here.
- **Python 3.9 / LibreSSL:** unchanged; `pdfplumber` installs cleanly on this stack.
- **Ephemeral hosting:** uploads via `/ingest` write to repo-relative paths; on ephemeral container filesystems they will vanish on restart. Documented in the Admin panel and in CLAUDE.md.

### Suggested First Action

None strictly required — MUST-D is complete and committed. If the next session needs direction, choose from the optional follow-ups above, or start a new IDEA / MUST-X batch.

---

## Session — 2026-04-17 (Session 26 / **SHOULD-A — IDEA 9 + IDEA 10**)

### Summary

**Batch label: SHOULD-A — IDEA 9 + IDEA 10**

Frontend-only onboarding pass. Two additive changes: a live role description under the role selector (IDEA 9), and a guided onboarding scenario grid replacing the passive empty state (IDEA 10). No backend, test, or model files touched. Reuses the existing `.example-btn` click handler and mirrors the MUST-A `updatePolicyDescription` pattern — no parallel state.

---

#### IDEA 9 — Role description

**Files modified (3):** `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/app.js`, `frontend/styles.css`

- **`index.html`** — wrapped the role selector in a new `<div class="role-selector-group">` (mirroring `.policy-selector-group`) and added `<p class="role-description" id="role-description"></p>` below `.role-options`.
- **`app.js`** — added `ROLE_DESCRIPTIONS` constant (analyst / vp / partner copy exactly per prompt, with the typo "internamos" corrected to "internal memos"); added `updateRoleDescription(role)` using the same 80ms opacity fade as `updatePolicyDescription`; wired `change` listeners on all role radios; initialized on page load with the default checked role. In the existing `.example-btn` handler, called `updateRoleDescription(role)` right after `roleRadio.checked = true` — programmatic checked sets don't fire `change`, so scenarios/example clicks would otherwise leave the description stale.
- **`styles.css`** — added `.role-selector-group` (flex-column, `align-self: flex-start`) and `.role-description` (mono, 0.61rem, tertiary, `max-width: 500px`, 80ms opacity transition).

#### IDEA 10 — Guided empty state

**Files modified (2):** `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/styles.css` (no new JS)

- **`index.html`** — replaced the `#empty-state` interior. Dropped the decorative hexagon SVG. New headline "How different policies change context assembly", an expanded subtitle, a `.onboard-grid` of three `<button class="example-btn onboard-card">` scenarios ("Permission Wall"/analyst, "Stale Detection"/VP, "Full Access"/partner), and a closing hint "Or type your own query above and choose a role to explore." Each card has role-color `.onboard-dot`, `.onboard-card-subtitle` tier label, `.onboard-card-title`, and `.onboard-hint`. Reused existing `.dot-analyst` / `.dot-vp` / `.dot-partner` color vars.
- **`app.js`** — no changes. The pre-existing `document.querySelectorAll(".example-btn").forEach(...)` at app.js:138 picks up the onboard cards at page load because they share the class. One query-trigger path, no fork.
- **`styles.css`** — added `.onboard-grid` (3-col grid, responsive 1-col ≤720px), `.onboard-card` (overrides `.example-btn`'s inline-flex row layout with column layout, card shadow, hover lift), `.onboard-dot`, `.onboard-card-head`, `.onboard-card-title`, `.onboard-card-subtitle`, `.onboard-hint`.

### Verification

**Tests:** 172 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (unchanged — no backend files touched).

**JS syntax:** `node --check frontend/app.js` clean.

**Diff stat:** `frontend/app.js` +34 lines, `frontend/index.html` +62/−25, `frontend/styles.css` +110. Three files; no backend.

**Playwright (via `webapp-testing` skill) — 15/15 passed, 0 console errors:**

### Current State

- **Branch:** `codex/must-a-idea1-2`
- **Last commit before this session:** `e1e3513` (MUST-D docs). SHOULD-A code + docs committed in this session.
- **Working tree:** clean after commit.
- **Tests:** 172 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed.
- **Evaluator:** unchanged (no pipeline touched).
- **Browser verification:** COMPLETE — 15/15 Playwright checks, 0 JS console errors.
- **Hostile review:** not performed (last clean verdict: Session 18).
- **Demo status:** READY.

### Known non-blocking behavior

- **Empty-state destroyed on first query.** `document.getElementById("empty-state")?.remove()` (app.js:setLoadingSingle) is pre-existing behavior — now the removed surface is the onboarding grid. Not newly broken by this batch; call out in case a reviewer flags it. Cards live for a session until the first query runs.

### Stale Docs Updated This Session

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Single mode description amended to describe the onboard-card grid (3-col → 1-col responsive), the role description paragraph, and the first-query removal behavior.
- **`docs/plans/2026-04-17-should-a-ideas-9-10-plan.md`** — canonical SHOULD-A plan (committed this session).

### Remaining Tasks

No SHOULD-A work remains. Long-standing optional follow-ups from prior sessions unchanged:

1. **(Optional) Remove dead code** — `apply_freshness()` and `filter_by_role()`.
2. **(Optional) Evaluator corpus re-read** — cosmetic.
3. **(Optional) Ephemeral-fs caveat** for MUST-D uploads — already documented.
4. **(Optional) Hostile review** — last clean verdict Session 18; MUST-A/B/C/D + SHOULD-A not rereviewed.

### Suggested First Action

None strictly required — SHOULD-A is complete and committed. If continuing, start the next IDEA / SHOULD-X batch.

## Session — 2026-04-17 (Session 27 / **NICE-B — IDEA 11 · Render-style Read-Only Deploy**)

### Summary

Packaging pass. Makes the repo deployable as a single Render web service: FastAPI JSON API + the static `frontend/` served at `/app/`. No business-logic changes. One env flag (`ALLOW_INGEST`) gates the write path; the frontend hides the Admin tab when the server reports it off. All edits are additive or defensive; `tests/test_ingest.py` stays green because the gate defaults to enabled.

### What was done

1. **`src/main.py`**
   - Imported `StaticFiles`. Added `_FRONTEND_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "frontend")` (CWD-independent resolution, mirroring `_ROLES_PATH`).
   - Added `_ingest_enabled()` helper: reads `os.getenv("ALLOW_INGEST", "true")` per-request, disabled only when the value is `"false"` or `"0"` (case-insensitive).
   - Extended `GET /health` to return `{"status": "ok", "ingest_enabled": <bool>}`.
   - `POST /ingest` now fails fast with `HTTPException(403, "Ingest is disabled on this deployment.")` before reading the request body when ingest is off.
   - Mounted `app.mount("/app", StaticFiles(directory=_FRONTEND_DIR, html=True), name="frontend")` at the bottom of the module — after all JSON routes so nothing is shadowed.
2. **`frontend/app.js`**
   - Replaced hardcoded `API_BASE` with a hostname-aware expression: `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / empty → `http://localhost:8000`; anything else → `""` (same-origin).
   - Added a non-fatal `/health` probe on page load. When `ingest_enabled === false`, hides the Admin mode button (`.mode-btn[data-mode="admin"]`) and `#admin-section`. Probe failures silently leave Admin visible (keeps `file://` dev working when the server is off).
3. **`Procfile`** (new) — `web: uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`. Consumable by Render's Start Command and by Railway's buildpack.
4. **`CLAUDE.md`** — new **Deploy (read-only, Render-first)** section covering build/start commands, env vars, `/app/` URL, `/health` capability probe, `API_BASE` matrix, ephemeral-fs caveat, and local quickstart.
5. **`docs/plans/2026-04-17-nice-b-idea-11-plan.md`** — canonical NICE-B plan (added this session).

Not done (explicitly out of scope per plan, P2/P3): no `.python-version` pin, no root redirect to `/app/`, no host-specific config (`render.yaml`, `railway.toml`, `fly.toml`).

### Files affected

- `src/main.py` (static mount, `/health` shape, `/ingest` gate, `_FRONTEND_DIR`, `_ingest_enabled()`)
- `frontend/app.js` (API_BASE resolver + /health capability probe)
- `Procfile` (new)
- `CLAUDE.md` (deploy section)
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` (this entry)
- `docs/plans/2026-04-17-nice-b-idea-11-plan.md` (new)

### Verification evidence

- **Preflight**: `git ls-files artifacts/` confirms three artifacts tracked; `git ls-files | grep -Ei '\\.env|\\.pem|\\.key|credentials|secret'` → empty.
- **JS**: `node --check frontend/app.js` → OK.
- **Tests**: `python3 -m pytest -q` → **172 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed** (unchanged from baseline).
- **Uvicorn smoke (ingest enabled)**:
  - `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok","ingest_enabled":true}`
  - `GET /app/` → 200, `text/html; charset=utf-8`
  - `GET /app/app.js` → 200, `text/javascript; charset=utf-8`
  - `GET /app/styles.css` → 200, `text/css; charset=utf-8`
  - `POST /query` → 200 with expected `doc_id`s for "ARR growth" / analyst
- **Uvicorn smoke (`ALLOW_INGEST=false`)**:
  - `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok","ingest_enabled":false}`
  - `POST /ingest` → `403 {"detail":"Ingest is disabled on this deployment."}`
  - `POST /query` → 200 (unaffected)
- **Procfile smoke**: `PORT=8000 sh -c "$(grep '^web:' Procfile | sed 's/^web: //')"` → server up, `/health` returns 200.

### Current State (end of Session 27 / handoff)

- **Branch:** `codex/must-a-idea1-2`
- **Last commit:** `0315c59` (SHOULD-A). **NICE-B is still uncommitted** — no commit SHA yet.
- **Working tree (uncommitted NICE-B batch):**
  - Modified: `src/main.py`, `frontend/app.js`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`
  - New: `Procfile`, `docs/plans/2026-04-17-nice-b-idea-11-plan.md`
- **Tests:** 172 / 14 / 0 (verified this session, ingest gate default-enabled).
- **Smoke checks:** all green this session — uvicorn default (`/health`, `/app/`, `/app/app.js`, `/app/styles.css`, `/query`), uvicorn with `ALLOW_INGEST=false` (`/health.ingest_enabled=false`, `/ingest` → 403, `/query` → 200), Procfile boot via `PORT=8000 sh -c "$(grep '^web:' Procfile | sed 's/^web: //')"`.
- **JS:** `node --check frontend/app.js` → OK.
- **Browser / Playwright verification:** NOT run this session. The `/app/` static-serving path + the `/health` capability probe (Admin tab hidden when `ingest_enabled=false`) are covered only by curl smokes, not by a full Playwright sweep. Carry forward as the first verification step after commit/deploy.
- **Review verdict:** No hostile review run this session (last clean verdict: Session 18; MUST-A/B/C/D/SHOULD-A/NICE-B not re-reviewed).
- **Demo status:** READY. Local URL: `http://localhost:8000/app/`. Production URL once deployed: `https://<render-host>/app/`.

### Render quick-reference

- **Start command:** `uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- **Build command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Env vars:** `ALLOW_INGEST=false` (required for read-only); `PORT` is auto-provided.
- **Deployed route:** `https://<render-host>/app/` (trailing slash required).
- **Caveat:** `/app` without trailing slash 307-redirects; ephemeral filesystem means Admin uploads would not survive redeploys even if enabled.

### Remaining / next steps

1. **Commit NICE-B** — 4 modified + 2 new files listed above. Suggested message mirrors prior batches, e.g. `NICE-B: IDEA 11 — Render-style read-only deploy (/app mount, Procfile, ALLOW_INGEST gate)`.
2. **Playwright sweep at `http://localhost:8000/app/`** — scenarios + Admin-hidden probe with `ALLOW_INGEST=false`. Intentionally deferred from this session.
3. **Deploy to Render** — create web service, set Start/Build commands and `ALLOW_INGEST=false`, verify `https://<host>/app/` reaches the demo.
4. **(Optional, P2 from NICE-B plan)** `.python-version` pin + root (`/`) → `/app/` redirect. Defer unless Render build or UX requires.
5. **Long-standing optional follow-ups (carried forward, unchanged):** remove dead `apply_freshness()` / `filter_by_role()`; cosmetic evaluator corpus re-read; hostile review refresh on MUST-A..NICE-B.

### Doc status at end of Session 27

- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — current (this update).
- `CLAUDE.md` — current (Deploy section added this session under NICE-B).
- `docs/plans/2026-04-17-nice-b-idea-11-plan.md` — current (Execution outcome section present; scope line clarified to Render-first).
- `docs/plans/2026-04-17-should-a-ideas-9-10-plan.md` — updated this session with an Execution outcome section (previously still read as preflight).
- `docs/plans/2026-04-17-must-d-idea-8-plan.md`, `docs/plans/2026-04-17-must-c-ideas-4-6-plan.md`, `docs/plans/2026-04-16-ideas-execution-plan.md` — unchanged, still accurate.
- `docs/plans/2026-04-10-pipeline-integration-plan.md` — unchanged, ARCHIVED banner from 2026-04-16 still holds.
- `roadmap.md` — does not exist in this repo; not referenced anywhere in the plan sequence.

## Session — 2026-04-18 (Session 28 / **NICE-A — IDEA 12 + IDEA 13**)

### Summary

Frontend-only polish pass. IDEA 12 adds an `.export-btn` (`⤓ Export JSON`) in Single mode (`.summary-bar`) and Compare mode (`#compare-banner`) that downloads the verbatim `/query` and `/compare` responses as pretty-printed JSON via Blob + `URL.createObjectURL` with a paired revoke. IDEA 13 adds subtle motion: mode-switch fade, result-card + metric-card hover lifts, spinner opacity pulse, and a smooth `max-height` transition on the Decision Trace panel (replacing the old `display: none↔block` toggle). All new motion respects `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`. Reuses the existing `--dur: 180ms` / `--ease` tokens.

### Files changed

- `frontend/app.js` — `downloadJSON(data, filename)` helper, Single export button + handler in `renderSingleResult()`, Compare export button append-with-dedupe in `renderCompare()`, `playModeEnter()` + `switchMode()` integration for `.mode-enter` fade-in.
- `frontend/styles.css` — `.export-btn` rules; `.result-card` entrance switched to `@keyframes result-card-in` (translateY 8→0) with hover translateY(-1px); `.trace-body` migrated to max-height + padding transition; `.metric-card` hover translateY(-2px) + shadow; `.btn-spinner` opacity pulse `@keyframes btn-spinner-pulse`; `.mode-enter` + `@keyframes mode-fade`; `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` safety net.
- `docs/plans/2026-04-18-nice-a-ideas-12-13-plan.md` (new) — preflight plan committed at the start of this session.
- `CLAUDE.md` — appended NICE-A paragraph under Frontend (export behavior + motion polish + reduced-motion).
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — this entry.

No backend files, no test files, no deps, no HTML changes. `tests/` untouched.

### Verification

**Baseline + post-edit pytest:** 172 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (both runs this session).

**JS syntax:** `node --check frontend/app.js` → OK. **CSS brace balance:** 363 open / 363 close.

**Server freshness check:** `curl -s http://localhost:8000/app/app.js | grep -c downloadJSON` → `3` (helper + 2 call sites; static mount reads from disk per request, no reload needed).

**Playwright sweep (via `webapp-testing` skill) at http://localhost:8000/app/ — 35/35 PASS, 0 JS console errors:**

| Area | Checks |
|---|---|
| Navigate | `/app/` loads with network-idle |
| Single mode | result-card rendered (5 cards for ARR/analyst/full); `.summary-bar` visible; `#export-single` visible with icon + label; download triggers filename `querytrace_analyst_full_policy.json`; payload has `context`, `decision_trace`, `total_tokens` |
| Trace panel | toggle exists; click adds `.open`; `.trace-body` computed `max-height: 4000px` when open; second click removes `.open` (smooth transition observed) |
| Result-card hover | computed transform `matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1)` on hover |
| Compare mode | 3 compare columns; `#compare-banner` visible; `#export-compare` visible; exactly 1 `.export-btn` in banner; download filename `querytrace_compare_analyst.json`; payload has `results` (3 policies) + `role`; re-run with VP and Partner scenarios → still exactly 1 export button per render; banner strong text matches new role |
| Evals | 10 `.metric-card`; hover computed transform `matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, -2)` |
| Mode fade | MutationObserver captures `.mode-enter` class add/remove across 3 mode swaps (≥2 events per swap) |
| Blob cleanup | After 10 exports in a row: 10 `createObjectURL` calls, 10 `revokeObjectURL` calls, 0 live URLs left (instrumented at `add_init_script` level before any page JS ran) |
| Console errors | 0 across entire session |
| `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` | In a fresh context with `reduced_motion="reduce"`, `.mode-enter` computed `animation-name === "none"`; mode switching still works; 0 JS errors |

Saved download artifacts at `/tmp/nicea_downloads/` for both filenames.

### Current State

- **Branch:** `codex/must-a-idea1-2`
- **Last commit before this session:** `d72e5da` (NICE-B). NICE-A commit added in this session.
- **Tests:** 172 / 14 / 0.
- **Evaluator:** unchanged (no pipeline touched).
- **Browser verification:** COMPLETE — 35/35 Playwright assertions, 0 JS console errors, Blob URL pairing verified by instrumentation.
- **Hostile review:** not performed this session (last clean verdict: Session 18).
- **Demo status:** READY.

### Known non-blocking behavior

- **Trace panel `max-height: 4000px` cap.** Current traces observed well under this (a few hundred px); if a reviewer constructs a pathological query with hundreds of blocked docs the body could clip. Acceptable for the demo corpus.
- **Compare-col entrance animation still uses the shared `card-in` keyframe** (`to`-only) with `forwards` — unchanged from before this batch. Only `.result-card` and `.metric-card` were migrated off `forwards`/`both` to let the new hover transforms take effect.

### Remaining Tasks

No NICE-A work remains. Long-standing optional follow-ups unchanged:

1. **(Optional) Remove dead code** — `apply_freshness()` / `filter_by_role()`.
2. **(Optional) Evaluator corpus re-read** — cosmetic.
3. **(Optional) Ephemeral-fs caveat** for MUST-D uploads — already documented.
4. **(Optional, P2 from NICE-B plan)** `.python-version` pin + `/` → `/app/` redirect.
5. **(Optional) Hostile review refresh** on MUST-A..NICE-A.

### Doc status at end of Session 28

- `docs/HANDOFF.md` — current (this entry).
- `CLAUDE.md` — current (NICE-A paragraph appended under Frontend).
- `docs/plans/2026-04-18-nice-a-ideas-12-13-plan.md` — preflight plan from this session; Execution outcome section can be added as a follow-up if desired (not required — this HANDOFF entry carries the evidence).
- All other plan docs — unchanged and still accurate.
